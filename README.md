### Self Reflection
I wanted to select three artifacts for my project that had personal significance for me. I wanted to choose projects which I would keep utilizing even after the requirements for this semester were finished, rather than ones that were just academic. I decided to concentrate on improving my e-portfolio, update code that I might use at work, and update a project to add functionality that would assist my growth.

For the software design and engineering portion of the project, I chose to apply what I learned in working with OpenGL library. In the class, we used these skills for a 3D animation, but for my final project I chose to apply them to my GitHub pages e-Portfolio. This project demonstrates my talents and ingenuity. In order to improve the design and make it more realistic in comparison to 2D things, I included a number of components. It shows off my ability to turn any 2D item into a 3D animation with a variety of characteristics.

For the algorithms and data structures part, I chose an artifact that was learned and completed in CS-260. It provided me with knowledge about how to approach a certain use case or problem. I started being familiar with numerous tools for writing manageable, performant code. I discovered how choosing the right data structure early on in the development of a program may improve data management and prevent issues like out of memory or stack overflow errors later on.
As I worked on the project, I discovered methods to leverage algorithms and data structures to increase its complexity and efficiency. This displays both my proficiency with algorithms and data structures and my proficiency with Python.

For the databases portion of the final project, I chose to apply what I learned in DAT-220 and created a cloud-based database. Assuming the company has a significant client base, I moved the data to a distributed file system. Using an open source framework, I enhanced data processing and schema enforcement beforehand so that the data science team could only utilize cleansed data while developing models.
